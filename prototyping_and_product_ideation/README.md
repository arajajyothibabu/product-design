## What is prototyping?
> Prototyping is all about developing a representation of your solution in a way that gives users and testers the opportunity to experience, test, and play around with the solution. 
> A prototype is not necessarily functional, but it does need to be something that can generate meaningful feedback from your users or testers. 

- **High fidelity prototypes** - realistic examples of end product
  > Eg. 3D design, Mobile APP
  - usability
  - look and feel
  ---
  - Lot of time to be realistic
  - costly
- **Low fidelity prototypes** - visual representations like sketch etc.
  > Eg. Story Board, Sketches etc.
  - Quick and inexpensive
  - Availability to all stakeholders
  ---
  - Lack of realism
  - usability testing

Commong pitfals to avoid
- Getting incredibly invested into your first prototype
- Becoming a serial pitcher or idea explainer
- Fear of failure
- Being dismissive of prototyping

Methods of prototyping
- Physical models
- Sketches and drawings
- Storyboarding
- Role playing

### User driven prototyping
> Asking users for their prototypes

- What are the key things you want to test? 
- What is your idea ultimately about?

## Minimal Viable Product
> A minimum viable product or MVP is the most basic, rudimentary version of your product or service, that can be released to satisfy the early adopters in the market. 
> It is effectively a version of your idea with the minimum functionality required in order for you to further test your hypothesis. 

Benefits of MVP:
- Validate understanding and assumptions
- Rapidly gain insights
- Minimise staff, funding and resources required
- A more robust product

Types of MVPs:
- Wireframes
- Mockups
- Explainer Videos
- Landing Pages

Scoping Minimal Viable Product:
- first document all the features or feature set of your product
- prioritize the features in the must-haves and the nice-to-haves
- Better still rank your priorities, but make sure you consider how the features interact with each other. 
- you need to decide what type of MVP you want to create in order to test these key features, wireframes, explainer videos, basic software et cetera.
- time to get building and testing

> **tip:** If you are going to outsource the development of your MVP instead of creating it yourself, be mindful of the intellectual property implications, and raise these concerns with the vendor before you get started.

## Why test your prototype ?
> The purpose of testing a prototype on real customers is not to assess the technical feasibility of building the product or service that you have designed. 

- Does this product or service solve a clearly identifiable market need?
- Do consumers understand what this product or service does?
- Will consumers see value in this product or service, and actually use it?

Ask questions during testing with your potential customers:
- Do you have any questions about this prototype? 
- What did you like about this prototype?
- What did you not like about this prototype?
- What would you use this prototype for?
- Would you use this prototype in your day to day life?

In addition to asking questions relating to the feature inclusions of your solution, in a design strategy context, it can also be important to test the business model that you intend to use.
- Would you pay money for this product or service? 
- If so, how much would you prepared to pay for this product or service?

> Prototyping is an iterative process

> Have a feedback loop for prototype

## What is ideation ?
> where you get to really go big and come up with all the inspirational, amazing, wacky big sky ideas to address the problem definition statement.
> the ideation process is about generating the ideas that will form the roadmap to address the problem definition statement.
> Each ideation process is likely to spawn its own prototype or modified prototype

> Start by breaking down your point of view statement into something more specific, and start asking "How might we..?", rather than saying 'We need to..".

People invovling in ideation need to have these behaviours or characteristics:
- Adaptable
- Opportunistic
- Disruptive
- Curious
- Dreaming
- Horizon scanning and connecting
- Experimental

Ideation process types:
- Problem to Solution
- Revolutionary
- Derivation
- Targeted discovery
- Serendipitous discovery
- Artistic Innovation
